go-matsuoka
===========

Gou Matsuoka is an anime character from Free!, she's the
manager of the swimming club.

I'm a programmer, turned manager who still loves to build
code. I was getting tired of doing resource management on
spreadsheets; so I decided to start writing this.

The goal is to build a command-line resource manager.
